Research identified three main options:\n\n**Top Recommendation: @bgotink/kdl**\n- 24 GitHub stars, latest version 0.4.0 (Nov 2025)\n- Format-preserving parser that maintains comments and whitespace\n- Native TypeScript with full type definitions\n- Best for config files that humans maintain\n\n**Alternative: kdljs (official)**\n- 147 GitHub stars, latest version 0.3.0 (Jan 2025)\n- Official KDL implementation with querying support (KQL)\n- Good for complex queries but less format-preserving\n\n**Decision: Evaluate @bgotink/kdl first** due to its format-preserving capabilities which are critical for config files. Test the library by:\n1. Installing the package\n2. Reading a sample niri config.kdl file\n3. Parsing and accessing nodes\n4. Testing modification and re-formatting to ensure preservation\n\nIf @bgotink/kdl works well, proceed with using it.
